This is a game project 
Project name: Rock Climber 
Canvas: true 
Players : 1
Obstacles : true 
Winning Condition : true 

---------User experience---------

The game will load with a start menu. The start menu will have the title of the game, "Rock Climber", at the top and two buttons, "start", and "instructions" Instructions will give the instructions to the game. 

The instructions are:
"Hop from platform to platform using the arrow keys. Make it to the top of the mountain to win the game. Press start to begin the game" 

Pressing start will begin the game and when the player jumps the first time, the platforms will begin to cascade down the screen. Each time the player jumps, the character will "flip" to mimic a person reaching with one hand and then the other. If a player falls to the bottom of the screen, the game will end, a message will say "You fell and may or may not be seriously injured" and then present the user with two options, "Play again" or "start menu". If a player makes it to the top, the game will end and the message, "You've reached the top! Rock on!" will appear along with the two buttons "Play again" and "Start menu" 


Possible additions: 

High score mode : no end, but the game keeps track of how high you have gotten. 

More levels 

Increasing difficulty : as the user gets higher up the cliff, the platforms start to speed up and boulders fall down. 

Character selection : user can choose multiple characters from the start menu
